            <p>My name is Bryton Palmer, I am 26 years old. I am married and live in Salt Lake City with my wife.
               I am new to the college experience and am super excited to learn more about the world of software development. 
               My wife and I are excited to be having a baby soon! It's all we seem to be able to 
               think about these days. We will be welcoming our first child in March 2026. I hope to learn all I can about 
               being a software developer so I can provide for my family and be the best husband and father I can be.</p>

            <p>Utah is a state in the western United States known for its diverse geography, including mountains, deserts, and national parks. It is home to five national parks, often referred to as the "Mighty 5": Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef. The state is also known for its rich history, particularly related to the Mormon pioneers who settled there in the mid-1800s.</p>
